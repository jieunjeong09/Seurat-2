# Seurat-2
Spacial transcriptomics
# Vignette for single cell preliminary analysis

## The main source

This Rmarkdown is based on `https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/spatial_vignette.html`
with some changes in graphics etv


## What we do

`SpacialTransc_jieun.Rmd` is the markdown file with initial processing of data from 10 X
Visium technology, obtained by testing and modifying (sometimes necessary) the main source.
For practical use, one
can add file saving commands for computed files and figures, and skip chunks with unwanted
figures etc.

This R markdown was tested and knitted, but sometimes its pdf does not display, so it may be necessary to download and view locally.
